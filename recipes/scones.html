    <p>
        Fill your home with the smell of freshly baked scones. 
        Taste members love them and we think the Country 
        Women's Association would approve!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>3 cups self-raising flour</li>
        <li>80g butter, chilled and cubed</li>
        <li>1-1 1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>Jam, to serve</li>
        <li>Whipped cream, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Sift self-raising flour into a 
            large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using your fingertips, rub butter into flour until 
            mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a well in the centre. Add 1 cup of milk . Mix with 
            a flat-bladed knife until mixture forms a soft dough, 
            adding more milk if required. Turn onto a lightly floured 
            surface. Knead gently until smooth (don't knead dough 
            too much or scones will be tough).
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly dust a flat baking tray with plain flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pat dough into a 2cm-thick round. Using a 5cm (diameter) 
            round cutter, cut out 12 rounds. Press dough together 
            and cut out remaining 4 rounds. Place scones onto 
            prepared baking tray, 1cm apart. Sprinkle tops with 
            a little plain flour. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or 
            until golden and well risen. Transfer to a wire rack. 
            Serve warm with jam and cream.
